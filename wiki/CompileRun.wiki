#summary HOWTO: Compile and run lynx with Visual Studio 200x

= External Libraries =

Download the following libraries:

  * enet: http://enet.bespin.org/download/enet-1.2.tar.gz
  * SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.13-VC8.zip
  * glew: http://glew.sourceforge.net/

Extract enet to a directory and open the "enet.dsp" project. Compile the enet library. Add library and include files to your VS path: Tools -> Options -> "Projects and Solutions" -> "VC++ Directories". Select "library files" and add a new line and select the enet "lib" folder. Then goto "include files" and add a new line for the enet "include" directory.

Extract SDL to a directory (you don't need to compile SDL) and add the include and lib directory in the same way as for enet. Copy the lib\SDL.dll to your lynx3d\lynx directory.

Same with glew.
